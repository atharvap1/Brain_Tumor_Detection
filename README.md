# Brain_Tumor_Detection
A brain tumor is the abnormal cell development in
the brain, some of which can progress to cancer.
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans are
commonly used to diagnose brain tumors. The
MRI scan contains information on the aberrant
tissue development in the brain. Machine
Learning and Deep Learning algorithms are used
in numerous research publications to detect brain
tumors. When these algorithms are applied to MRI
scans, the prediction of brain tumors is very quick,
and the increased accuracy aids in the treatment of
patients. These forecasts also assist radiologists in
making quick decisions. A self-defined
Convolution Neural Network (CNN) are used in
the proposed work to detect the presence of brain
tumors, and their performance is evaluated.

Introduction

The brain is the most essential organ in the human
body, controlling the performance of all other
organs and aiding in decision making. It is
basically the control center of the central nervous
system and oversees the human body's everyday
voluntary and involuntary functions. The tumor is
a fibrous web of abnormal tissue development
inside our brain that grows uncontrollably. This
year, around 3,540 children under the age of 15 are
diagnosed with a brain tumor. The correct
understanding of brain tumors and their phases is
critical for preventing and carrying out the
measures in curing the sickness.
Radiologists typically employ magnetic-resonance
imaging (MRI) to evaluate brain malignancies in this
manner. The study performed in this Project indicate
whether the brain is normal or is affected by brain tumor
by employing deep learning techniques.
The major goal of this Project is to compare models like
CNN and VGG-Net by training them on a dataset of
7022 photos. Extensive study and testing were
conducted in order to establish the appropriate
hyperparameters. The Precision, Recall, F1-Score and
Support are the measures used to assess the performance
of the model and select the best one.
